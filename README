THIS IS A PROJECT THAT USES THE PROCESSING PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE (YOU KNOW 
WHAT I MEAN) TO CREATE A FULLY PLAYABLE CATAN GAME. INITIAL PLANS ARE FOR AI
OPPONENTS, THOUGH SAME-COMPUTER-DIFFERENT-PLAYERS MAY BE USED TO TEST THE 
BASIC MECHANICS OF THE GAME.

THIS WAS UPDATED 22 MAR, 2015. I INCLUDE THIS SO THAT I CAN LOOK AT HOW LONG
JOEL TOOK TO LEARN TO USE GIT AND LAUGH. OR CRY. ONE OF THE TWO. ALSO, IF YOU
ARE READING THIS AND THE YEAR IS STILL 2015, JOEL, THEN CONGRATULATIONS!
